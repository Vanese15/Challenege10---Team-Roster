# Challenege10---Team-Roster
I built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information 
about employees on a software engineering team.  The applicaltion
allows users to select a role from the options.  When all the 
desired selections are chosen, the application generates a team
profile in HTML.

The HTML team profile generator is styled in cards with employee role
name, id and email address.  The manager has a field for office number, 
engineers have a field for github username and the intern has a field for the
school they attend.

WHEN I start the application
THEN user is prompted to select role
WHEN role is chosen from list
THEN user is prompted for the team members and their information
WHEN all selections have been made, HTML cards for team roster is generated
